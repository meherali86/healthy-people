                                About half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich
                                in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and
                                bread. It is a good idea to include at least one of these at
                                every meal. Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and
                                cereals, will increase our fibre intake.

                                    avoid trans fats; reading the labels helps to identify the

                                eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fresh
                                fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of
                                watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables

                                proper meals. For snacks, we could choose yoghurt, a handful of
                                fresh or dried fruits or vegetables (like carrot sticks),
                                unsalted nuts, or perhaps some bread with cheese.

                                Adults need to drink at least 1.5 litres of fluid a day! Or more
                                if it's very hot or they are physically active. Water is the
                                best source, of course, and we can use tap or mineral water,
                                sparkling or non-sparkling, plain or flavoured. Fruit juices,
                                tea, soft drinks, milk and other drinks, can all be okay - from
                                time to time.

                                The right weight for each us depends on factors like our gender,
                                height, age, and genes. Being affected by obesity and overweight
                                increases the risks of a wide range of diseases, including
                                diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer.

                                Excess body fat comes from eating more than we need. The extra
                                calories can come from any caloric nutrient - protein, fat,
                                carbohydrate, or alcohol, but fat is the most concentrated
                                source of energy. Physical activity helps us spend the energy,
                                and makes us feel good. The message is reasonably simple: if we
                                are gaining weight, we need to eat less and be more active!
